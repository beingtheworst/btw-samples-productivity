Collaboration
=============

For the simplicity (and to keep full history of changes) we will be keeping all organizational aspects of this project in this file (at least in the beginning).

You can propose changes or handle them by doing commits (or pull requests). If you find yourself doing many pull requests, then we can grant you direct write access to the repository.

**Help is welcome and cool!**

In this file:

1. **TODOs** (help the project)
2. **People** (add yourself)


1. TODOs
----

These are the tasks that need to be done. Please, feel free to take ownership of the tasks. We can reorganize tasks section later, to fit Scrum, Agile or whatever.

* Set up an empty project infrastructure under `src` folder (copying SaaS stuff, but cleaning it up and renaming, while keeping Lokad.CQRS as binary reference) 
* Document technical vocabulary of the project (Views, Projection etc).
* Provide project template for domain modeling and specification writing (put it under `prototypes`).
* Capture first domain model using the provided template in `prototypes\yyyy-mm-dd-model-1` 
* Get a list of people actively interested in the project and organizing a quick conference call.
* Continue adding TODOs here **/ by Rinat**
