About Prototypes Folder
=======================

`\prototypes` folder contains experimental spikes and domain models, that we want to keep as a reference and don't want to represent as separate git branch.

New prototypes are to be put into the folders inside this folder: 

    \prototypes\yyyy-mm-dd-prototype-name 
    
for example:

     \prototypes\2012-10-04-domain-model
     
Ideally, each prototype folder:

* is stand-alone (does not have any external dependencies)
* contains `Readme.MD` file with a short description of the purpose (just a sentence or two would be enough)
